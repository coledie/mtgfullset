# Full Set

Full MTG set list generation from Scryfall to TCGPlayer/CardKingdom mass entry.

Makes it easy to make draft sets with exact card styles for each set.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To run this locally, ask some Copilot agent like Claude to get it running locally for you via NPM.
Several pieces of code need to be changed to handle conversion from github spark app to local but I was able to do it with "Figure out how I can set this up and run it locally, verify it works".
